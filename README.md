Yako project
==============================

Nowadays private and social communication is mostly based on personal devices (e.g. smart phones, tablets, etc.).
The main platforms of private interactions are e-mails, Google Talk, Facebook messaging, SMS, etc.
To the best of our knowledge, mostly different applications offer these services and there are no open
source projects that provide these functionalities within a single application.

These are the reasons why we started the Yako Android project in mid 2013.
Our goal is to create an application that makes it possible to manage all of the most relevant types
of textual messages (SMS, e-mails, Facebook messages) in one application, so the user does not have to
use different applications to interact with friends in different channels.

In the near future we would like to personalize the message notifications and the application usage,
on the basis of the user habits, behavior, reactions and the contents of messages.
